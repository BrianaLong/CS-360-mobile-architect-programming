Weight Tracking Android App

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app is a weight tracking application that allows the users to log their desired goal weight and daily weights. The weights are stored in a database. Once the numbers match the goal weight notification is pushed via sms.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The first screen contains the user login and account creation screen. The second screen has the database features including buttons to add daily and goal weights, and a chart for the previously entries. The third screen for sms notification acceptances. Having a simple cohesive UI is important for users. Keeping the font, colors and organization for each screen makes a better application.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I ended up with a waterfall approach to coding my app. I had done multiple iterations. FOr the next app I will apply an agile approach to coding.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested my code with an emulated android app. I also downloaded it onto my android phone to make sure it was functional and looked right on the screen.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Each part of the procees gave me a challange. WHen coding I had to rewrite the code. When making the UI I had to do a few iterations.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The code is the most successful part in demonstratying my knowledge.
